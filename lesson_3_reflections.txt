When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to collaborate on a project by making the source code of what you have done available to people, i.e. for open source projects. The other use proprietary storage for company's projects at one place. This one is private and there is no public access. 
a third use might be for individuals wanting to secure their code by storing it on web. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because you simply might not want those changes to take effect in your file yet. They may be committed from a different person or a from a different computer, which might interfere with your current progress. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Suppose A has shared his source code for a project on GitHub. If B wants to work on it too, he will fork it to get it on his own GitHub profile. By doing so he will not be able to make changes to the original version shared on A's profile. He is just cloning it directly to GitHub. Later if he wants to make changes to the code, he will have to clone it to his own computer. If he wants to test a new feature while working on a main thing, he can create a branch which later can be merged. If it works out and he wants to push these changes to GitHub, the changes can only be made on his forked copy.
